# SyncPlan — Contact Form 

## Overview

The contact form lets users send messages or feedback. It includes fields for name, email, subject, and message.

## Files
- contact.html – form structure
- contact.js – handles form submission
- contact.css – styles the form

## How it works

- User fills in their name, email, subject, and message.
- The form checks that all fields are filled in.
- It sends the data to your chosen endpoint (like Formspree or a simple backend).
- A success or error message shows after submission.
